# 👋 Hi, I'm Kaki Lai

I’m a creative developer-in-training with a background in visual storytelling and emotional UX — currently studying **JavaScript full stack development** at **Northcoders** (UK-based bootcamp).

## 🚗 Building with heart: Commate Drive

My current passion project is **Commate Drive**, a voice-based Emotional AI assistant designed to support solo drivers — not just with directions, but with *empathy*.  
Think of it as a calm friend in the passenger seat — one that listens, reflects, and speaks at just the right moment.

🧠 Built with:
- HTML / CSS / JavaScript (ES Modules)
- Browser-native Speech Synthesis
- Emotion-based logic & tone design
- React + GPT API (coming soon)

> “You’re not driving alone — Commate stays with you.”

## 📚 Background

Before learning to code, I spent 10+ years in creative communications and video storytelling.  
Now I’m connecting that emotional insight with interactive tech — building tools that **feel human**.

📍 Based in Manchester  
📬 Open to junior dev roles, especially in creative tech / AI / UX innovation

## 🧡 A bit more about me

Outside of code, I love:
- 📷 Capturing solo travel moments with photography and short films  
- 🚍 Exploring cities (yes, even as a former London bus driver!)  
- 🎨 Doodling ideas in notebooks when the mood hits  
- 🐾 Dreaming of future road trips — with a dog, a cat, and a camper

Whether you're a dev, designer, or dreamer — if you care about emotional design or AI companionship, I’d love to chat!
