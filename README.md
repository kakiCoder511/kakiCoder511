## 📚 Background

Before learning to code, I spent 10+ years in creative communications and video storytelling.  
Now I’m connecting that emotional insight with interactive tech — building tools that **feel human**.

Comfortable working across the stack using JavaScript, React, Express, PostgreSQL and MVC architecture. Experienced with Test-Driven Development (TDD), REST APIs, and collaborative workflows.

📍 Based in Manchester
I’m open to junior developer roles, especially those at the intersection of tech, creativity, and wellbeing.

## 🧡 A bit more about me

Outside of code, I love:
- 📷 Capturing solo travel moments with photography and short films  
- 🚍 Exploring cities (yes, even as a former London bus driver!)  
- 🎨 Doodling ideas in notebooks when the mood hits  
- 🐾 Dreaming of future road trips with a dog, a cat, and a camper
