# 👋 Hi, I'm Kaki Lai

I’m a creative developer-in-training with a background in visual storytelling and emotional UX — currently studying **JavaScript full stack development** at **Northcoders** (UK-based bootcamp).

## 📚 Background

Before learning to code, I spent 10+ years in creative communications and video storytelling.  
Now I’m connecting that emotional insight with interactive tech — building tools that **feel human**.

📍 Based in Manchester  
📬 Open to junior dev roles, especially in creative tech / AI / UX innovation

## 🧡 A bit more about me

Outside of code, I love:
- 📷 Capturing solo travel moments with photography and short films  
- 🚍 Exploring cities (yes, even as a former London bus driver!)  
- 🎨 Doodling ideas in notebooks when the mood hits  
- 🐾 Dreaming of future road trips — with a dog, a cat, and a camper

## 🛠️ Let’s connect!

Whether you're a dev, designer, or dreamer — if you care about emotional design or AI companionship, I’d love to chat!
